# Rust BSQ
This program was one of the first one I did in my first year in university. We had to make it in C.
While learning Rust I thought it would be cool to develop those first programs again. Indeed it was a good
idea, I discovered a lot of new methods I didn't know about when I was starting that actually make the
development of the programs easier.
